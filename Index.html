    Latest release  
    
    How can you reduce this downtime?
    We had a base version of our software and then we added a few features
    on top of it and then we released this particular version
    It's this version that has a lot of issues like the base version
    is working perfectly fine, but the extra features that we added to 
    our base version is what is causing our issues so what we can do is 
    we can reach out to our artifact repository and back the work base version
    and deploy our base version till the time we make our bug fixes, we will
    roll back to our base version while we're making the bug fixes.
    Version 1.1 is the one that has bugs
    What we will do is that we will roll back to version 1, make this available to our 
    customers while we perform our bug fixing on version 1.1 once the Box bug fixing
    is fine we can take out version 1 and then redeploy version 1.1

    *If you were able to resolve it, how would you share your
    knowledge with the other team members? *
    Keep in mind:We aim to have our applications online 24/7. Issues
    that we face are time critical!

    - I would ask them if they’re having the same issues, then if I resolved those issues, I would tell them how I did it, in slack or it depends where we communicate.
